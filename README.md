This is a test viewer for iOS (ipad/iphone) that loads up some catalog information, data.gov, data.noaa.gov, geoplatform, and some individual endpoints. It surfs the endpoints and allows you to pick multiple layers and overlay them.

It needs:
 * for new NowCoast it needs WMS time support and a time slider UI
 * WMTS support
 * Can we pull down ESRI Rest data and view it with Whirly? like geojson?
 * better UI
 * fix the search UI and add to data.noaa.gov / data.gov
