# WMSViewer

This is a test viewer for iOS (ipad/iphone) that loads up some catalog information, data.gov, data.noaa.gov, geoplatform, and some individual endpoints. It surfs the endpoints and allows you to pick multiple layers and overlay them.

This uses Whirly as the map SDK.

It needs:
 * for http://new.nowcoast.noaa.gov/ it needs WMS time support and a time slider UI
 * WMTS support (merge from here: https://github.com/alvissalim/WG_NASAGIBSExplorer )
 * Can we pull down ESRI Rest data and view it with Whirly? like geojson?
 * better UI
 * fix the search UI and add to data.noaa.gov / data.gov
